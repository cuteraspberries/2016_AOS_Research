Okay so my parents just said that they read an article describing how Washington DC helicopters bascially fly around and have biosensors
to detect whether there is a bioweapon being made?  Or like a dirty bomb?

So this got me thinking...what if I could diagnose something like HIV using a biosensor?  
Okay but now that I think about it, the biosensor would have to have contact with the individual...

Gonna scan some links..

OKAY THIS IS COOL: Metastatic Cancer Cell Biosensor

In case you forget one day, metastatic means that the cancer spread to other parts of the body via lymphatic or cirulatory system (blood vessels).

An example is the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM).  I can't really figure out how it works because the math seems complicated
but essentially the sensor have receptors with high selectivity towards receptors on cells (cancerous and noncancerous)...and 
somehow it comes up with a quantitative measurement of the amount of cancerous cells rather than a qualitative one from that 
of ..for example.. a mammogram.
